# CoffeeScript<sub>Async</sub>

This is a small modification to [CoffeeScript](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript) which adds support for the proposed ECMAScript 7 [async function syntax](https://github.com/lukehoban/ecmascript-asyncawait). This doesn't make any attempt to make this syntax usable in JavaScript engines that don't already support it natively (currently none of them); so in practice the idea is to chain this to [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) or something of that sort and compile it down to its underlying ECMAScript 6 generator representation, or, via [Regenerator](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/transformers/other/regenerator/), further down to compatibility with ECMAScript 5 and probably most major web browsers going back at least a few years.
